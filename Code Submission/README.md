## Description
This submission consists of all the code needed to replicate the results provided in our Assignment 3 report. This directory consists of the following inputs:
1. __`Data_Processing_and_Visualisation.ipynb`__: Download the dataset, perform data inspection and visualisation, then preprocess them into suitable model inputs. Running this file should return the preprocessed data.

## How to run
To ensure optimal run, it is recommended to run the notebooks in numerical order list in the previous section, and roughly 6-12 hours is recommended. Some of the following conditions are assumed:
- Data are put in `train` and `test` folder, which is in the same location as this notebook
- GPU is enabled. For CPU run, expect roughly 10 times the recommended time
- Packages are current up-to-date versions of Google Colab on May 2023 (Python 3.10.11). For list of versions, refer to `package_version.txt`

For enquiries on running the code, the main person in charge of each code part can be contacted:
1. __`Data_Processing_and_Visualisation.ipynb`__: Tuan Khoi Nguyen (tuankhoin@student.unimelb.edu.au)
